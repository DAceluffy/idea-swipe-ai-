# Idea Swipe AI  
A swipe-based idea discovery tool that helps creators find trending startup, content, and micro-SaaS ideas instantly using AI.

## 🚀 Overview  
Idea Swipe AI is a simple but powerful tool designed for students, creators, and beginners who want to start something but struggle to find the right idea.  
Instead of spending hours searching YouTube, Google, or Instagram, users can simply **swipe** through AI-generated idea cards — similar to Tinder, but for inspiration.

Each swipe shows:
- A trending idea  
- A short explanation  
- Category tags  
- Difficulty level  

Users can like or save ideas to view later.

## 🎯 Why I’m Building This  
Most beginners quit because they don’t know what to build.  
This tool removes the “idea paralysis” and turns the internet’s noise into something simple and actionable.  
My goal is to empower young creators by giving them a clean, fun, and fast way to explore new ideas.

## 🛠 Current Progress  
- Basic UI layouts created  
- Swipe card prototype working  
- Idea categories defined  
- Early AI integration tests  
- Preparing backend for idea scoring

(Will update with new commits as development continues.)

## 📌 Tech Stack  
- HTML / CSS / JS
